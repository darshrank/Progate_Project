1. QuaranTime Management
2. Tech stack used: html,css,bootstrap,javascript
3. It is a website to spend your time in a productive manner. In this quarantine time many activities as well as productive learning can be    done. This website also provides a to-do list.
4. Due to shortage of time and limited knowledge of web development we have just made a basic website with some basic stuff we knew. But      thinking about the idea this website can be used by users to plan their time ,make a time table, and follow it. Student persuing CS        field courses can use this website to see the suggestions and get an idea to the courses of their interest. We would also provide the      sources offering the courses of learning in the learn webpage and provide the sources of movies provided in suggestions but we werent      able to do it due to lack of time.
